# IPExpander
If you are looking for a tool to automatically expand IPs of a subnet you can probably find a more updated and reliable version [here](https://github.com/AnnaOpss/IPExpander)

# So, what is it then?
This is just an exercise of writing a lexer/parser for a formal language from scratch

## Dashed parser:
This is the lexer automata for the language:
![alt text](/parsers/automata.png "State Machine")

Some examples of the language are:
```
	"10.0.0.1-2"
	"10.0.1-2.1"
	"10-11.0.1-2.1"
```

It also accepts missing extremes, 0 or 255 will be used if not specified
```
	"-1.0.-.1"
	"10.0.1-2.254-"
	"10.0.1-2.255-"
```

The final output can wrap around limits:
```
10.0.0.255-1 â†’ 10.0.0.255,10.0.0.0,10.0.0.1
```

The final output of the parser is a `4x2` matrix containing the ranges the IPs should vary within (extremes are included) that is then converted into the list of `net.IP` addresses

The parsing approach used is described [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxaD_trXwRE), I just wanted to try it out
